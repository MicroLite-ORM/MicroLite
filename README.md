MicroLite ORM Framework
=========

MicroLite is a small lightweight or "micro" object relational mapping (ORM) framework written in C# for the Microsoft .NET framework.

It currently supports Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySql and offers a number of advantages over other micro ORM frameworks:

* It only references the .NET base class libraries (no dependencies outside the .NET framework itself).
* It is built for .NET 3.5 client profile, .NET 4.0 client profile and .NET 4.5.
* It provides extension points for Logging frameworks, Mapping Conventions, Session Listeners, Type Converters and SQL Dialects.
* It is easily managed by IOC containers.
* It is easy to test code which uses it.
