MicroLite ORM Framework
=========

MicroLite is a small lightweight ORM framework which falls into the Micro ORM category.

Although the current version only supports Microsoft SQL Server, it offers a number of advantages over other micro ORM frameworks.

* It only targets the .net base class libraries so you are not forced to also tie yourself to version X of framework Y.
* It supports .net 3.5 and 4.0 Client profile.
* It is easily injected
* It is easily tested (i.e. it is easy to test code which uses it)
* It supports pluggable extensions for logging etc
