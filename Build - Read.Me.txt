Before building, ensure that you have StyleCop installed (currently version 4.7.32.0)
If running on a 64 bit machine, run the PowerShell (x86) executable otherwise the StyleCop.targets won't be found.

** To just build the binaries in release mode with all tests run:
.\build.ps1

** To build the NuGet package you must specify the project name and version:
.\build-nuget.ps1 -projectName MicroLite -version X.X.X

** To also push it to NuGet.org after creating the .nupkg you must supply push true:
.\build-nuget.ps1 -projectName MicroLite -version X.X.X -push $true
