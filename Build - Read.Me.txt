Build scripts etc assume that the repository is checked out to C:\Source\GitHub\MicroLite\ if this is not the case, 
you may not be able to run the build scripts or open the SandCastle or NDepend projects.

Requirements:

  - Visual Studio 2010 or later
  - .NET 4.5
  - Sandcastle Help File Builder 1.9.7 (http://shfb.codeplex.com/)
  - StyleCop version 4.7.45.0 - ensure that MSBuild integration is selected when installed (http://stylecop.codeplex.com/)
  - Git (http://git-scm.com/download/win)

Optional:

  - NDepend 4.1 or later

If running on a 64 bit machine, run the PowerShell (x86) executable otherwise the StyleCop.targets won't be found.

** By default, the build will run in release mode, run all tests and generate the compiled help:

	.\build.ps1

** To also build the NuGet package you must specify the version:

	.\build-nuget.ps1 -version X.X.X

** To also push it to NuGet.org after creating the .nupkg you must supply push true:

	.\build-nuget.ps1 -version X.X.X -push $true
