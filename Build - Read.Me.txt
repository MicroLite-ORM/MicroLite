Requirements:
 
  - .NET 4.0

Before building, ensure that you have StyleCop installed (currently version 4.7.35.0)
If running on a 64 bit machine, run the PowerShell (x86) executable otherwise the StyleCop.targets won't be found.

** By default, the build will run in release mode, run all tests and generate the compiled help:

	.\build.ps1

** To also build the NuGet package you must specify the version:

	.\build-nuget.ps1 -version X.X.X

** To also push it to NuGet.org after creating the .nupkg you must supply push true:

	.\build-nuget.ps1 -version X.X.X -push $true
